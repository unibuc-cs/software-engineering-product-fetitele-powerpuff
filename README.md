Healthy Lifestyle Web App  
Web application for tracking nutrition and physical activity from day to day built using ASP.NET Core for backend, React for frontend and Microsoft SQL Server database.  
Users can log the food they eat, the physical activities they do and the amount of water they drink in a day. They can see how many calories (and macronutrients) they have consumed or burned. The app also computes the amount of calories that should be consumed in a day using the user's weight and goal.  
Users can add new foods that are only visible to them, but they can make requests for them to be public.  
They can also browse recipes that contain all the necessary ingredients and preparation steps, read articles written by experts in nutrition and sports and view cooking tutorials.  
Admins have control over various features of the application, they can promote and delete users, manage foods, activities, muscles, articles, recipes, tutorials and they can approve or deny requests to make user foods public.
